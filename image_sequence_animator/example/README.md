## Description
This is a very simple widget for animating a set of images (a.k.a: an image sequence) as an alternative to using a GIF file. GIF files are, as far 
as I know, not possible to control. With this package, you will have full control over your image sequence. You can loop, boomerang, change the 
color, play, pause, stop, skip, rewind, restart and more.

## How-to-Use
First, add your image sequence to your assets and update the "pubspec.yaml" accordingly. Then simply create an ImageSequenceAnimator widget with 
your parameters. That's it!

Please see the example project and the documentation for understanding the parameters.


## Notes
I started using and learning Flutter only some weeks ago so this package might have some parts that don't make sense, 
that should be completely different, that could be much better, etc. Please let me know! Nicely! 

Any help, suggestion or criticism is appreciated! 

Cheers.
